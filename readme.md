## What is it? 

LEXICON is a collection of high level javascript libraries to create interactive and synchronizable graphs and dashboards. I am updating these pages slowly.

* Projects
  * The Mutaframe ([<img src="../img/mutaframeLogo.png" width="50" height="50" vspace="10" hspace="10" align="middle"/>][MUTAFRAME]) project, started in 2016 aims to be a visualization platform for mutations in human proteome (single nucleotide variants on coding regions of the human genome)
  that is guided by machine learning. What was unique about the project is that, it's not just about visualization of any data, it is related to healthcare. Several tools that is developed during this project (including this one) can also be used for generic purpose.
  I will document and release these tools as I sieze the opportunity.
* Organizations
  * [<img src="../img/ibsquare.png" width="50" height="50" vspace="10" hspace="10" align="middle"/>](http://ibsquare.be/) for a fruitfull project that lead to development of [Mutaframe][MUTAFRAME] and many other micro libraries.
  * [<img src="../img/europa-flag.gif" width="50" height="50" vspace="10" hspace="10" align="middle"/>](https://europa.eu/european-union/index_en) for coordinating funds for the [Mutaframe][MUTAFRAME] project which eventually lead to development
  of many small libraries including this one.
  * [<img src="../img/innoviris.png" width="100" height="20" vspace="10" hspace="10" align="middle"/>](http://www.innoviris.be/en?set_language=en) for funding the [Mutaframe][MUTAFRAME] project.

## Support
I work on several small to medium sized projects. Development in one can also lead to development of the others. So if you would like to show your
support for this project you can contribute to my [PATREON](https://www.patreon.com/ibrahimTanyalcin) page.
